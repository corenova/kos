# User's Guide

This documentation provides information on interacting with [Kinetic Reactor](./intro.md#kinetic-reactor) modules utilizing the `kos` CLI utility.

The `kos` utility provides an *interactive-prompt* interface for operating a running instance of the `kos` process. You can think of `kos` similarly to `node`, with the key difference being that instead of interacting with the JavaScript runtime, you are interacting with the KOS runtime.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with **KOS** is to start the `kos` program and begin interacting with it.
```bash
$ kos
kos>
load       load/path  process    program    prompt     reactor    read       require    show       .info      .help      .quit      

kos>
```
The above output is generated when you press `<TAB>` for auto-completion after entering the `kos` interactive shell.

### What is the KOS runtime?

The **KOS** runtime is an operating environment where one or more [Kinetic Reactor](./intro.md#kinetic-reactor) modules are loaded and *actively reacting* to the running environment.

When you start the `kos` utility, the [run](../reactors/run.md) reactor is loaded as one of the reactors for the **KOS** operating environment.  The [run](../reactors/run.md) reactor provides runtime context reactions to the Node.js `process` object as well as `program` object that captures the CLI arguments.  

### kos -h

```
  Usage: kos [options] <reactors...>

  Options:

    -h, --help         output usage information
    -V, --version      output the version number
    -e, --expr <kson>  eval KSON expression and feed into KOS
    -d, --data <file>  feed KSON file contents into KOS
    -s, --show         print detailed info about reactor(s)
    -v, --verbose      enable more verbose output
    --silent           suppress all debug/info/warn/error log messages
```

The `kos` command-line utility internally uses the
[run](../reactors/run.md) reactor to dynamically load reactor
modules from the local filesystem.

### kos --show

The `--show` option provides a visual rendering of a reactor module.

The below output was generated by performing *introspection* of the
[debug](../reactors/debug.md) reactor used by the `kos` utility.

```bash
$ kos --show debug
debug: reactions to send debugging messages to an output stream
├─ id: b3951676-2564-49d2-833b-edc91bfb6d80
├─ passive: false

└──┐
   ├─╼ debug/level ╾─╼ ƒ(setupLogger)  
   ├─╼ error       ╾─╼ ƒ(outputError)  
   ├─╼ warn        ╾─╼ ƒ(outputMessage)
   ├─╼ info        ╾─╼ ƒ(outputMessage)
   └─╼ debug       ╾─╼ ƒ(outputMessage)
```

Using the `--show` option, you can easily extract useful information
regarding data objects that the reactor `requires`, the various
`triggers` and `reactors` contained inside the reactor, as well as
`inputs` and `outputs` for each of the reactions.




The [run](../reactors/run.md) reactor is one of the more
interesting [available reactors](../README.md#available-reactors) and
taking the time to understand how the [run](../reactors/run.md)
reactor operates will prove to be an invaluable exercise in mastering
**KOS**.

## Loading Reactors

TBD...

## Chaining Reactors

There are **two** primary ways for building data pipelines across
multiple reactors: nested or peering.
