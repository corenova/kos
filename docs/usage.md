# User's Guide

This documentation provides information on interacting with
[Kinetic Reactor](./intro.md#kinetic-reactor) modules.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with **KOS** is to use the provided
`kos` CLI utility to interact with various
[available reactors](../README.md#available-reactors) included in the
**KOS** project repository.

### kos -h

```
  Usage: kos [options] <reactors...>

  Options:

    -h, --help         output usage information
    -V, --version      output the version number
    -e, --eval <kson>  eval KSON statement and feed into KOS
    -d, --data <file>  feed KSON file contents into KOS
    -s, --show         print detailed info about reactor(s)
    -v, --verbose      enable more verbose output
    --silent           suppress all debug/info/warn/error log messages
```

The `kos` command-line utility internally uses the
[engine](../reactors/engine.md) reactor to dynamically load reactor
modules from the local filesystem.

### kos --show

The `--show` option provides a visual rendering of a reactor module.

The below output was generated by performing *introspection* of the
[engine](../reactors/engine.md) reactor used by the `kos` utility.

```bash
$ kos --show engine
├─ name: engine
├─ purpose: Provides KOS engine load/start reactions
├─ requires
│  ├─ module/path
│  ├─ stdio
│  └─ module/fs
├─ triggers
│  ├─ ƒ(loadReactor)
│  ├─ ƒ(chainReactor)
│  ├─ ƒ(pipelineIO)
│  └─ ƒ(startEngine)
└──┐
   ├┬╼ module/path ╾┬╼ ƒ(loadReactor)  ╾─╼ reactor
   │└╼ load        ╾┘
   ├─╼ reactor     ╾─╼ ƒ(chainReactor)
   ├─╼ stdio       ╾─╼ ƒ(pipelineIO)
   │┌╼ stdio       ╾┐
   └┼╼ module/fs   ╾┼╼ ƒ(startEngine)
    └╼ start       ╾┘
```

It's a handy way to extract useful information regarding data objects
that the reactor `requires`, the various `triggers` contained inside
the reactor, as well as `inputs` and `outputs` for each of the
reactions.

## Loading Reactors

TBD...

## Chaining Reactors

There are **two** primary ways for building data pipelines across
multiple reactors: nested or peering.
